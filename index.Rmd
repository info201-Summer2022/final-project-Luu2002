## Suicide Rate By Mental Health in different countries

### Introduction

Every day there are many people commit suicide across the world and lots of the time people commit suicide due to there mental health and other personal issues too. I genuinely worry about people's mental health, particularly during and after COVID-19. Many people may have overlooked the seriousness of this problem despite the lock down's obvious negative effects on people's mental and psychological actions and perceptions. And maybe by employing code analysis, we can determine how strongly the epidemic and suicide rates are related.

### Table of Summary

-   The first table shows the suicide age rate per 100,000 population in different countries. The info was from the most recent dataset by WHO. From the dataset an pertinent observations that I found was how male suicide rate are higher then female by age.

| Location | Year | Gender | Avg_rate | Low_rate | High_rate |
|----------|------|--------|----------|----------|-----------|

|           |          |            |          |          |          |
|-----------|----------|------------|----------|----------|----------|

-   The second table shows the different facilities that different countries has. Looking at the data I found that pertinent observations is how Japan has the most mental hospital compare to the other countries. Which I though United States should maybe would have more in comparison.

| Country | Year | residential_facilities | mental_facilities | daily_treatment |
|---------|------|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|

| Cuba | 2016 | 1.213 | 0.166 | 0.445 |

### Charts

#### Scatter Plot

The purpose of this scatter plot is to have a clear look at the facilities in each countries.
The pertinent observations that I found was how comparing the 8 countries Japan has one of the top for mental hospital
and one of the top for daily treatment which was kind of suprising to see how high it is.

The purpose of this chart is to see the relationship between Japan and the United States.
Pertinent oberservation is how America in a differetn data has the highest suicide rate comparing to other.
![Funnel Chart](/Users/luluuchenn/Desktop/Rplot01.png)

The purpose of this chart is for fast visual on the country of the highest suicide rate by facilities.
By looking at it Japan is the countries with the most and how Cuba has the most residential facilities and poland has the
second most daily treatment
